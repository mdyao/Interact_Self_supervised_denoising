:rocket: This is the official repository of Interactive_Self_supervised_Denoising (TCSVT 2023). 



**Our approach allows users to select the denoising output that well suits their perceptual requirements, making it a more subjective and personalized experience.**



We provide the training and test code along with the trained weights and the dataset (train+test) used for this work. If you find this repository useful, please :star:star this repo  and :page_facing_up:cite our paper .

## Codes

<!-- This repository is the **official implementation** of the paper, "Towards Interactive Self-Supervised Denoising", where more implementation details are presented. -->



We have two stages for training.

Please run the train.py for training and test.py for testing. 

More details will be updated recently. If you have more questions, please contact me.
